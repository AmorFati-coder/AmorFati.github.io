下周听说课，有任务安排，主题随意，正好今天下午拜读了《星之继承者》

​	<!--more-->

​	Today I want to introduce a book to you: "Inherit the Stars".

​	This is a story about human beings marching towards the unknown.

​	The story is developed following the scientific research started after the discovery of Charlie, as the ancient human found on the Moon gets nicknamed. It’s a story of archeological mysteries and the attempt of the scientists who study them to find answers based on information that appears increasingly contradicting.

​	The research is based on the existence of an ancient race of humans that get called Lunarians. Charlie proves that there was once an advanced civilization but his discovery leads scientists to ask a series of questions. However, every answer seems to contradict the result of some of the previous analyzes. But at the end of the first part, they deduced a shocking conclusion.

​	I want to quote a passage from the book as the end. 

> That same driving force we see in man today. Man has proved invincible in every challenge that the Universe has thrown at him. 

PS： When I finished reading it, I suddenly thought of the lines in "Star Trek": ''We used to look up at the stars and think about our position in the universe. And now we only look down, worrying that we won’t find a place to bury ourselves after we die. '' I don't hope that human beings will come to such a situation.
